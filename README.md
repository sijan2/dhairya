# Remotion Dhairya

This template is for creating "audiograms". In other words, video clips from podcast episodes, or any other audio. It's a popular way of sharing audio snippets on social media.

[Example video](https://twitter.com/marcusstenbeck/status/1460641903326732300)

Start changing things like this:

- Adjust size and length in `src/Video.tsx`
- Replacing audio, cover and subtitles in the `src/assets` folder
- Tweak `src/Composition.tsx`

## How do I render my video?

Run this:

```console
npm run build
```

Or check out the [Remotion docs](/docs/render/). There are lots of ways to render.

## Where to get a transcript (SRT file)?

There are a few places:

- Your podcasting host might provide them for you.
- Descript makes transcription really easy.
